In this course, you will learn the benefits, typical use cases, and technical concepts of Amazon Redshift. You can also try the service through a demonstration using the AWS Management Console. The cloud data warehouse service integrates with data lakes based on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). It also integrates with relational database services such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, Amazon RDS for MySQL, and Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition. Amazon Redshift supports building and using machine learning (ML) models using familiar SQL commands, thereby reducing the skills needed to take advantage of ML. This course includes presentations, graphics, and a demonstration with the option to follow along. Course level: Fundamental, Duration: 1 hour.
